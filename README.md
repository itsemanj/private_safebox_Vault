# Self-Vault: Personal Encrypted Password Manager (CLI)

A **secure, self-contained password vault** written in Python.
All credentials are encrypted locally using **AES encryption** with a master password-derived key.
No plaintext credentials are ever stored, and the database is stored locally using **SQLite**.

This is perfect for personal use and can be cloned from GitHub for your own vault.

---

##  Features

*  AES-256 encryption with **PBKDF2HMAC key derivation**
*  Master password authentication
*  SQLite-backed storage, fully self-contained
*  Interactive CLI, no coding required
*  Non-coder friendly commands
*  Dynamic: no hardcoded credentials

##  Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* `cryptography` library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsemanj/private_safebox_Vault.git
cd personal\ vault
```

2. Install in **editable mode** (recommended during development):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This allows any code changes to take effect immediately.

3. Verify the CLI command works:

```bash
vault help
```

##  CLI Commands

| Command        | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `vault init`   | Create a new vault and set a master password  |
| `vault login`  | Unlock the vault (prompt for master password) |
| `vault add`    | Add a new service credential interactively    |
| `vault list`   | List all saved services                       |
| `vault get`    | Retrieve username & password for a service    |
| `vault delete` | Delete a service from the vault               |
| `vault help`   | Show all available commands                   |

##  Example Usage

```bash
vault init
# Create your master password
```

```bash
vault add
# Service name: Gmail
# Username: myemail@gmail.com
# Password: ********
# Saved ✔
```

```bash
vault list
# Output:
# Gmail
# GitHub
# Netflix
```

```bash
vault get
# Enter service name to retrieve: Gmail
# Output:
# Username: myemail@gmail.com
# Password: ********
```

```bash
vault delete
# Enter service name to delete: Gmail
# Deleted ✔
```

##  Security Notes

* The **master password** is never stored. It is used only to derive the encryption key.
* The database (`vault.db`) and salt (`vault_salt.bin`) are stored locally in:

```
~/.self_vault/
```

* Losing the salt or master password **will prevent access to all stored credentials**.
* SQLite file is encrypted, so even if stolen, the contents are protected.

---

##  Tips

* Use a **strong, unique master password**.
* Back up `vault_salt.bin` securely.
* Do not share your vault database file or salt.
* For non-coders, all interactions are via simple CLI commands — no Python editing required.

---

##  Next Steps / Enhancements

* Add **password generator** for new credentials
* Add **auto-lock** after inactivity
* Export/import encrypted vaults
* GUI version (Tkinter or PyQt)
* Support cloud syncing with end-to-end encryption
